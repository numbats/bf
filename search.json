This has to be expressed directly to me (and only me) via a formal email stating facts that have hindered the operations of the group (saying I do not like George because he is tall is not a reason for expressing concern). If at least two such complaints are submitted during the completion of an assignment, the group member concerned will receive a warning. If the situation is not improved during the next assignment and another two complaints are again submitted, the group member will be immediately removed from the group and will be expected to complete the rest of the group assignments alone.\nIn my involvement with group assignments we have rarely needed to enforce such rule so I do no expect any major problems here. However they will be enforced if need be. I hope this is clear.\nWe need only one submission per group for each group assignment."

So if you score 8/10 for IA3 and 5/10 for GA3 your mark for Assignment 3 will be 8*0.7+5*0.3=7.1 out of 10. Hence, it is important to make sure that groups are performing at the highest standard.\nPresentation requirements: using Rmarkdown, and should converted the assignment into pdf output file unless otherwise specified.\nCriteria for marking: Provided the task has been completed and your code runs without errors, full marks will be awarded. Marks will be deducted for incomplete tasks or if there are errors.\nPenalties for late lodgement: The University has a standard penalty for late submission. See the Marking and Feedback Procedure for more information\nAdditional information: Additional information regarding this assessment will be provided during the scheduled class time and on Moodle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Participation - ETF5231 Students ONLY\n\n\n\nGroup participation rules for group assignments (GAs): It is expected that all group members participate equally to the group assignments. It sometimes helps to keep a log of the tasks each member is to complete. This may assist in keeping some balance throughout the semester. To ensure that all group members are contributing the following rules will apply for all the group assignments throughout the semester.\nEvery group member has the right to express concern/dislike in terms of a group member being absent from group activities. This has to be expressed directly to me (and only me) via a formal email stating facts that have hindered the operations of the group (saying I do not like George because he is tall is not a reason for expressing concern). If at least two such complaints are submitted during the completion of an assignment, the group member concerned will receive a warning. If the situation is not improved during the next assignment and another two complaints are again submitted, the group member will be immediately removed from the group and will be expected to complete the rest of the group assignments alone."
